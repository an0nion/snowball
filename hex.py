         creditworthiness objectively. It ranges from 300 to 850, calculated \
         using factors like payment history, credit utilisation, and credit age\
         , amongst others. Its statistical distribution is typically right-skewed\
         , with the majority of scores clustering in the 670â€“739 range, \
         considered fair to good credit. High scores (740+) are less common, \
         representing excellent credit, while scores below 580, indicating poor \
         credit, are relatively rare.")
